<h2><i>This post explores some basic conscepts of JS</i></h2>

    <p>
        If you read my previous blog on <a href="/blog/technicalBlog/IdsVclass">id's and classes</a> you may recall an analogy in which I described HTML as a film script and CSS as a concept-artist/cinematographer and set dresser, in charge of executing aesthetic decisions of our ‚Äòfilm‚Äô or ,‚Äî‚Äîin non-metaphor-land‚Äî‚Äî-web document.<br>
        But what of javascript?<br>
        It may be the special-affects team, we mused; Well, in this blog post we are going to dive a little more into why and how that might be, as-well as discussing the DOM, javascript functions,  control flows, loops, arrays and objects. 
        Phew! It is a lot, so grab a drink of water, or something stronger, and let us dive in.<br>
        
        
        Let‚Äôs start with the DOM, or Document Object Mode.<br>
        
        The DOM is an interface‚Äî‚Äîwhich simply means a point of connection between two systems, subjects or languages. The DOM is cross-platform and language-independent; For our purposes, we could see it as bilingual and able to ‚Äòread‚Äô any code we throw at it, regardless of the language.<br>
        How the DOM ‚Äòreads‚Äô an HTML or XML document is more uniform however; It is looking for a particular shape of pattern, typically described as a tree structure; Not unlike a family tree, the hierarchy of an HTML document can be expressed in branch-like forms, with every tag (or branch) being an object, and every nested tag being the ‚Äòchildren‚Äô of that enclosing branch.<br> 
        The ‚Äòhtml‚Äô tag would be the roots, the ‚Äòhead‚Äô and ‚Äòtitle‚Äô could be branches.<br>
        
        As programers, we can use these tags to access and manipulate inclosed information;
        <br>For instance we could...<br>


        
        <center><img style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 40px; max-width: 60%; opacity: 80%;" src= "/images/javascript.png" alt=‚Äúdev tools example of text change"></center>

        <p>

        The DOM inspector is equiped with developer tools that make it easy to select and read tags and open/collapse the information inside them.<br>
    
        A program‚Äôs control flow is the order in which code is executed; It is a vital part of programming.<br>
        
        Imagine you take a nice refreshing shower, but then change into smelly clothes? <br>
        Or, you change into fresh clothes, but have just spent hours at the gym sweating‚Ä¶<br>
        The order a code is executed plays a vital role in how affective and useful that code is.<br>
        
        A code will run from first line to last line, unless a computer runs into structures that we put in to alter that running order.<br>
        This means we can manipulate the order to fit multiple scenarios or respond to a huge range of inputs.<br>
        
        Some of the ways we do this is with conditions and loops.<br>
        
        ‚ÄòConditions‚Äô appear when we present a program with a particular condition and tell it how to respond if that happens.<br>
        We can then tell it to respond differently if something else happens instead or/and as-well.<br>
        
        For instance:
    </p>
    <pre>
    <p class="demo">
        if (field==empty)  {
               promptUser();
                    } else {
               submitForm();
        }
    </p>
    </pre> 

<p>
        Loops are used when we ask a program to repeat a particular process over and over again until a certain condition (that we choose) is met.<br>
        
        
        If we were rugby coaches we could tell our team to run around the field until they have completed a circuit twenty times.<br>
        
        Asking a computer to count incrementally up to 20 using a loop would look like this;<br>
</p>
    <pre>
    <p class="demo">
        for(var i = 0; i < 21; i++){
            console.log(i)
        }
    </p>
</pre>
   <p class="caption2"><i>This loop will print numbers 0-20, will stop when condition is met (i = 20)</i></p> 
 
    <p>
    The ‚Äòloop‚Äô the computer is preforming is the process of adding one number to the count (I++), over and over again. .<br>
    We can then add actions, such as asking a computer to do something (ie. console.log the numbers) until a particular condition is reached.
 </p>
<pre>
<p class="demo">
        var i = 0;
        while(i < 10){
            console.log(i)
            i++
        }
 </p>
 </pre>
    <p class="caption2"><i>This loop  will print number 0-9, will stop when condition becomes false (i >=10)</i></p>
    <br>
    <br>
        
        <h2>Functions </h2>
        
    <p>
        Functions are chunks of code designed to preform a task.<br>
        When we write a function, it will not execute until something ‚Äòcalls‚Äô it and the conditions we have coded into it are met.<br> 
        This might occur through an event (a button turns blue when it is clicked), thorough referencing it in another section of code or linked document, or writing it to self-evoke.<br>
        Functions are often written to return a value or action. <br>
        
        Similarly to how a store manager might ask their employees to say ‚ÄúGood morning, can I help you?‚Äù To every customer, a function could execute a similar code, which could be called by clicking on a link or button, or even from the loading of a page.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
  
        <h2>Arrays and objects</h2>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 5%;">
        In javascript, almost everything can be described as an object (booleans, numbers, strings, dates, trays, functions and ‚Ä¶.objects). <br>
        An object can exist as information, or it can exist to store a lot of information. <br>
        For instance an array is a type of veritable (sometimes an object) that can contain more than one value. If you wanted to store a list of items, you could store it in an array. <br>
        While a ‚Äòstring‚Äô is used to describe a series of characters or words that exist like a sentence (or many sentences), an array contains characters, while remembering that they are separate, allowing you to select and alter, replace or reference just one, easily. <br>
        You could imagine an array like fridge-magnet poetry; You can easily grab and swap out words without having to slice up the page of a book. <br> 
        An object could be the fridge or the finished poem or a single word from our poem-array; We use that word to describe something in javascript when it is a standalone entity with properties and type, that can be accessed as a single unit. <br>
        Phew! That was a lot. <br>
        If you got to the end of this rather dry lesson, then thank you for your time, here is a tiny award : <br>
