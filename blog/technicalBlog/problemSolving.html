I recently came across a coding problem that made my temples ache and my jaw clench, which is unfortunate because viewing a problem through a lens of temple-aching, jaw-clenching frustration is unlikely to produce clarity.<br>
The problem went like this;<br> 
I was asked to: <br> 

</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 20px;">

<li>Write a bit of code that represented a grade-book; It would be an ‘object’</li>

<li>Create a separate a bit of code that represented a student with a name and score.</li>

    <li>Create two more student ‘objects’.</li>

        <li> Write each students name in the gradebook, and link it to the data of the student-objects.</li>
 
            <li>Create an ‘addscore’ function that would retrieve a student’s grades, when their name was given as data.</li>
 
                <li>Create a function called ‘average’ that would calculate the average of any number that was given to it.</li>

                    <li>Create a function that ‘called’ the ‘grade average’ function for that student, when a name was given as data.</li>

                        <li>Write a line of code that would ‘return’ the final value automatically</li>


</h3>>
<p>
I hated it. <br> 
Immediately I was having flashbacks to my acne-chinned,  oily-haired adolescence; Gazing out the window during the barbaric torture, known as ‘math-class’.<br> 
I began grumbling about my ADHD and dyslexia and maths(!) <br> 
I had been learning javascript for less than two weeks and each new problem seemed to push my head just below water.<br>  
</p>
<center>*</center><br> 
<p>
First, I tried; Over and over again. <br> 
Trying to hold all of the components in my head at once.<br> 
I spent a long time staring at the question prompts; working and re-working the same bit of text again.<br> 
Finally, I took a break. Made a snack. Went outside and returned with more deliberate intention.<br> 
‘Pseudo-code’ is one of my favourite methods of problem-solving right now. <br> 
The method involves writing the steps you will need to take to generate a solution to your given problem, in plain, familiar, uncomplicated language.<br>  
Firstly, this breaks a problem into smaller, more-manageable problems; Secondly, it stops you from trying to hold several complicated problems (and their moving parts) all in your head at once. <br> 
I began to progress.<br>  
Then, inevitably hit another road-block; The code I wrote was retrieving all of the student’s data and grades…except one.<br>  
I had made an ‘Elizabeth’ object, yet her grades were not being read, nor their average found. <br> 
After a little bit of dumb, bemused scrolling, I realised the very obvious and silly mistake I had made; Not writing Elizabeth’s scores. <br> 
I had left the ‘score:’ section of my Elizabeth-object blank. <br> 
What I recognise now about this interaction (between myself and the question) is that sometimes something appears very simple, and makes you feel foolish…<br> 
When you begin unpacking the number of questions in a question; Or the number of components you have to manage and make work, it may be a little easier to look upon yourself and your work with patience, compassion and even a little pride.<br>  
I spent a lot of time that day, under the ‘hood of my car’, lost in wires, when what I needed was to take a step back and patiently check the most basic things, rather than presuming I was failing the ‘complicated bits’. <br> 
When I used the ‘console.log’ function to ask the computer what information I had saved on each student’s name, it was obvious that Elizabeth’s data was missing. <br> 
And it seemed like a foolish mistake.<br>  
Because all mistakes seem foolish, once you see them.<br>  
The trick is in letting yourself make them, over and again, and knowing when to step away and breathe.<br> 
</p>
<h1>Problem solving: Oh, the elegance! </h1>
<p>
I was having problems understanding ‘arrays’ in relation to the ‘.lenth’ function. <br> 
Which to a non-coder may sound a little like “I was having trouble snoodling my bazoomber according to the blipperbottom algorithm’, so let me give you some context; <br> 
In javascript an ‘array’ is an ordered list of values. <br> 
Each of these values are known-as an ‘element’, and an array stores them on an index. <br> 
To find out how many elements are in an array, you can use the <i>.length </i> property. <br> 
<p>

<pre> 
<p style="font-family: unset;">
    let myArrayOfBeans = [ 'baked', 'magic', 'chili', 'cat-paw' ]
    console.log(colors.length); //4
</p>
</pre>

<p class="caption">
You can ‘push’ elements onto an array ; 
</p>

<pre> 
    <p style="font-family: unset;">
    myArrayOfBeans.push('been');
    console.log(beans.length) //5
    </p>
</pre>

<p class="caption">
And look! the length of that array will change.<br>  
</p>
You can also grab whatever element or elements of an array you would like using methods like </i> find() </i> or <i> indexOf() </i>> and referencing the index number of that element.<br> 
</p>
<pre>
    <p style="font-family: unset;">
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];
    console.log(numbers.find(e => e % 2 == 0));
    </p>
</pre>
    <p class="caption">
    for instance this code finds the first even number in this array
</p>
<br>
<p>
Easy-peesy-lemon-squeezy you say! Perhaps.<br>  
But this was all new stuff to me, and although I understood the concepts of arrays and indexes, a bunch of new information, patterns and words were entering my head at once, after weeks of cramming knowledge in there.<br> 
Then came the idea of looping arrays by length and <i> the remainder operator (%) </i>.<br> 
There were several problems I battled through that featured both, but the great-big problem that I solved ‘elegantly’ ——<i> to borrow a dev-question phrase </i>——-was teaching myself to understand how looping worked, when my brain had such trouble processing the information and sources I had been given to learn those concepts.<br>  
I taught myself the best way I knew how;<br>
<i>Playing.</i><br> 

<center><img class="responsive3"src="/images/loop.jpg" alt="hand-drawn notes on looping in js"></center>

<p>
Perhaps a dryer form of play then I would typically share, but a game none-the-less.<br>  

I am curious about animation, and so decided to use the concepts that I had to learn (the necessary components of the curriculum, that I would need to know for later) to do something I really, really wanted to do…<br> 
Switch between a bunch of drawings of magical-cats-with-lazer-beam-eyes ‘on click’.<br> 
And just to challenge myself, I thought I would try to work out two different ways to do it and incorporate my most feared opponents;
<br>
The <i>remainder operator(%) </i> and <i>.length.</i><br> 
<br> 
<h3 style="font-size: 20px;">
I wanted to write a function that would :
<br>
<i>change the image of a cat when a user clicked on it</i>
<br>
<br>
One way to do this would involve :</b> 
<br> 
<br> 
<li>creating an array of cat images</li>
<li>writing a function that would cycle thought any array I gave it, one-by-one.<br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In this case it would be looking through all my cat pics. </li> 
    <li>telling that function to start at 0, or the first cat picture.</li>
        <li>Telling that function to count incrementally by one ( this is done by adding a ‘++’)</li>
            <li>telling the function to devide object's index no. by the total length of the index.
                <li>writing a function that would ‘call’ or initiate my amazing cat-cycling function.</li>
</h3>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Phew!<br> 
The elegance came when I COULD NOT COMPREHEND how my cat-counting function returned to zero.<br> 
Where did it get the number zero from?<br>  
How did it know to return?<br>  
Careful readers might have noticed that the ‘length’ function meant that the count could never exceed the amount-of-elements in the array, but I had trouble absorbing this information.<br>  
I came up with two solutions.<br>   
And boy where they elegant!They were so elegant, they might as well have been wearing top-hats and fake moustaches!<br>  
First, I made a view finder.<br>   
I cut a line of four small rectangles out of a bit of paper and labeled them ‘no.0’, ‘no.1’, ‘no.2’ and ‘no.3’.<br>  
Then, I grabbed four dice that were laying on my table and arranged them in a circle.<br>   
I pretended the dice where four different laser-cat pictures and then I held the view-finder above them and rotated it, noting that it only ever counted up to four.<br>   
Eureka!<br>   
I understood how the length of an array could limit the amount of pictures my function would be looking for.<br>  
But just to really hammer the idea home I took a little look at ‘for loops’, another looking concept I had been struggling with.<br>  
</P>

<center><img class="responsive3"src="/images/forloop.jpg" alt="hand-drawn notes on for-loops in js"></center>

<p>
I noticed that you can tell ‘for loops’ to repeat a certain action until the condition that you have given it, stops being true.<br>  
While the function loops, it can go over the same numbers again and again and repeat the same actions.<br>   
I imagined this as being like the ouroboros; An ancient symbol of a serpent, looping around and consuming its own tail. It progresses both infinitely and not-at-all.<br>  
</p>
<center><img class="responsive4" src="/images/snake.gif" alt="place-holder for my illustration"></center>

<p>
You may be asking what is so elegant about thinking of a snake. The elegance is this; I learn in stories, images and day-dreams. I retain information through imagining characters and noticing patterns and personifying the elements that make-up a pattern and telling it back to myself as a fairytale.<br>  
It makes maths less spooky and alien to me.<br>   
So, the elegance here is not in the code, but the way in which is playfully and joyfully made sense in my head ; The moment of ‘click’ that might as well have been magic. It was in recognising that, though I might struggle with some forms of learning and some resources, I can find ways to enjoy taking in information..even if it seems terribly difficult! <br>  
I have been asked to discuss the following problem-solving techniques and processes and how confident I feel using each: <br>  
Pseudocode<br>  
Trying something<br>  
Rubber ducky method<br>  
Reading error messages<br>  
Console.logging<br>  
Googling<br>  
Asking your peers for help<br>  
Asking coaches for help<br>  
Improving your process with reflection<br>  

And although the teachers pet in me would like to do exactly what it asked, I believe that as someone who is decidedly not Nuerotypical, I have to spend a lot of time and energy into adapting my learning styles and adapting content to fit me, and it is more important to me to recognise the things that I have noticed are working for me, and point out how they are working then try to analyse deeply other possible ways of working.<br>   
I will say that I am relatively comfortable with all the listen methods…but more importantly I am comfortable knowing that I am someone who actively notices what works and what doesn’t work for my learning and alters my approach to fit. <br>  
I have atypical thinking and learning styles that make writing or researching teaching-resources that are aimed at neurotypical thinking-patterns difficult or tedious at times…so I will continue to ‘do me’ and learn how I like to learn. Even if it isn’t a usual or designated method.<br>  <br>
