<h1>On ethics</h1>


<div class="flex-container">
    <div class="box">
        <p>The world is often deeply unfair, deeply unkind and somewhat confusing. It is my aspiration to treat everyone and every situation with compassion and fairness, regardless of how I get treated. This does not mean allowing others to be abusive or exploitative, but it does require putting aside my personal feelings or chemistry towards someone when it comes to judging their actions and behaviours; For instance, I will not treat unkindness, abuse or harassment by returning those behaviours. My ethics require that I hold myself to a standard of compassion and appropriate behaviour, even when my feelings are hurt or others do not treat me with the same respect. 
        For instance in my previous job, there was a fair amount of jealousy in which others would spread rumours and gossip to clients in the name of stifling the competition. One worker even sought to kick down by encouraging the media to attack the immigration status of those who she believe to be ‘undercutting the competition’.
        I took the approach of supporting all workers and remaining professional in conversations with clients, even when I myself experienced harassment and abuse; I would warn colleagues if there was someone who I believed it was unsafe to work with, and firmly tell someone that I was uncomfortable with their behaviour if I witnessed them bullying another worker, but in terms of clearing up rumours about myself or engaging with misinformation that was spread around me in the hopes of swiping my clients, I acted rather oblivious, focusing on my performance and being honest, rather than stooping to any kind of mud-flinging. 
        I suppose my culture of growing up in a very dysfunctional religious cult-like-situation meant I am sensitive to bullying and people using authority as a way to manipulate and hurt other people.
        I am extremely aware of power-imbalances and the fact that some voices are elevated above others and some people experience all kind of invisible and visible struggles due to socio-economic, cultural or physical reasons and I do my best to use my privilege wisely and in a way that supports others.
        I know a strength of mine to be my ability to see people——truely see people!—-and make them feel heard. 
        This involves listening carefully and finding a language to engage with someone that fits them best and makes them feel comfortable (for instance, my work has involved engaging with people with autism, people with physical disabilities, trans and gender queer people and people who are often pushed to the peripheries of society in very intimate spaces that involve mutual trust). 
        I think being fairly comfortable with my ability to adapt my language to fit others is definitely going to be as strength in studying, as well as the joy I find in deliberate, enthusiastic play as a way of learning. 
        I think I am also very good at including others into conversations (especially those who may be shy or struggle to be heard and listened to) which will be great for collaboration. 
        A time where I experienced tension in collaboration was at university in a group project where we were supposed to collaborate with writing; We were a group of three and I was the only one who submitted content. I thought that if I kept my head down I would succeed and I wasn’t too bothered about being left to do the bulk of the work until my team mates began taking credit for the work I had done. At time I expressed concern but was overruled by the two more confident voices. Since then, I have experienced many instances of others trying to exploit my labour, time or knowledge for their benefit in unfair ways (eg. the ol’ unpaid artist/photographer thing) and have learnt to acknowledge my labour and effort and value my own time, in a way that requires others to do-so, particularly if they expect to benefit from it. </p>
        I have since become more successful in articulating my expectations and needs which is helpful seeing as I very naturally ‘smooth over’ social interactions and factor other people’s needs and wants in very easily, making working with people more equal and organic rather than feeling powerless and as though I have to defer to the loudest voice.
