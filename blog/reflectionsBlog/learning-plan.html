		<h2>
			Here are the answers to the questions I was recently asked around my learning plan for
			dev academy (bootcamp).
		</h2>
		<br />
		<p>
			My career goal is irrelevant right now. Instead, the goal I have is fall in love with
			programming; To learn some ways to sit with frustration. To gain enough understanding
			that I can notice and enjoy making-and-disrupting patterns-of-information. To find
			multiple ways to ‘solve’ a problem, and begin to get comfortable with ‘playing’ with
			code.
			<br />
			I hope to get to a stage where I can use these skills to amplify voices that need to be
			amplified, or make information more accessible to marginalised groups…<br />
			but for now, I am focusing on noticing how I feel and what I enjoy. I imagine my
			interests and curiosity will dive me from there.
			<br />
			<br />
			My challenges in bootcamp may centre around my struggles to take in written-and-numeral
			content, self-doubt and ‘freezing up’ under pressure, or allowing other people to ‘rule
			over’ me in situations where they might have some socialised power.
			<br />
			I have a bunch of internalised misogyny and I am neuro-divergent in ways that can make
			learning institutes challenging, so I think communicating clearly, asking for help and
			not comparing myself to others will be very important.
			<br />
			I am pretty confident in my ability to respect boundaries, listen actively and
			supportively to others and work really hard…
			<br />
			I have an unusual approach to many things which can mean I struggle to grasp concepts
			that seem simple to others, but it also means I can come up with creative solutions
			(hurrah!).
			<br />
			I sometimes find it difficult working with other people, because I tend to ‘mask’ and
			that is exhausting… I can also sometimes try too hard to centre other people’s feelings,
			to the point where I overlook my own, so I am going to try to keep making space for
			myself and treat my own feelings with the respect that I treat other’s.
			<br />
			I feel pretty confident with my human skills, although practicing boundary-setting is
			always good. I generally feel good about my ability to treat everyone with empathy,
			patience and respect and allow people space/a voice… <br />
			sometimes it is hard to expect the same treatment from others however when my instinct
			is to ‘smooth things over’ or submit to dominant behaviour or aggressive communication
			styles. I hope I don’t experience this at Dev, but it would be a challenge…otherwise I
			am happy with my human skills.
			<br />
			I am on the ASD spectrum so I communicate ‘abnormally’, but I know who I am and how I
			like to treat people; And I can’t imagine altering those high expectations of myself or
			requiring ‘more’ of myself in that way. <br />
			I had to develop ‘human skills’ manually and deliberately so I have focused on them more
			than many neurotypical people I believe.
			<br />
			<br />
			My expectation of the bootcamp team is to be supported in having a safe environment (ie.
			free of bullying/harassment/boundary pushing) and some flexibility and patience around
			the way I learn.
			<br />
			<br />
			My expectation of myself prioritise my own safety and mental health over any other type
			of ‘success’. <br />
			I have a very high ethical standard of my own behaviour and treatment of people, that
			does not depend on how I feel about someone or how they treat me, so I don’t feel like I
			need to set those standards (my focus on therapy has been around controlling my
			overly-strong empathetic instinct so that I don’t tolerate abusive of boundary-pushing
			behaviours)… <br />
			I hope (but am not sure that I expect) to not take things too seriously, but see this
			bootcamp as a chance to play and enjoy noticing patterns and what they can do. <br />
			I am a hard worker and work best when I am learning through play and deliberate,
			enthusiastic observation… <br />
			So I think I need to divorce myself from seeing this as high-stakes; Because I know that
			I will respect the resources and knowledge that is being shared with me. <br />
			And I know I will respect and honour other students learning, and take my
			responsibilities in team work seriously… So it is important that I relax a little, and
			realise that this experience can be enjoyable, and I don’t need to punish or berate
			myself into learning.
