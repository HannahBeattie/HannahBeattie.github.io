		<h1>
			What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the
			core learning?
		</h1>
		<br />
		<p>
			Three things I have learnt about myslef are:<br />

			1. I am more comfortable than I thought making space for my neurodivergent mind/learning
			style than I thought I was. Even at the expense of doing a task ‘incorrectly’.
			<br />
			2. My alternate learning style, although challenging for myself at times, can be a
			strength in terms of pattern-recognition.
			<br />
			3. There are people making space for people like me in the industry…<br />
			well, this was more based on my interactions with my facilitator than the specific core
			learning, but I suppose our conversations were inadvertently part of of my core
			learning, even if it wasn’t in the handbook.<br />

			I find it difficult to locate my ‘ego’; I think my autism means that I don’t understand
			a lot of the value judgements neurotypical culture places on comparison and being ‘more
			successful’ than others.<br />
			I learnt a little about other people’s egos; And how I can safely negotiate space for
			myself in situations where other peoples comparisons or value judgements of me may be
			skewed by their own self-perceived intelligence or need to appear important…<br />
			I suppose that ‘ego’ (originally) was used to describe the part of the mind that
			mediates between the unconscious and conscious performance of our body…. In which case,
			I could say that I learnt that there are some academic situations where I can remove
			some of my ‘mask’ safely…<br />
			But if ego is being used in it’s more colloquially relevant way, I would say that I have
			a very different way of experiencing social interaction to many, and I don’t feel
			particularly prideful or like I need to be ‘more successful’ or ‘more intelligent’ than
			anyone… I am just putting my head downing and learning and I really hope we all succeed.
			<br />

		<h1>
			What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?
		</h1>
		<br />

		<p>
			I have covered this point particularly heavily on my empathy blog post, so I don’t think
			I have more to say on the subject, other than that programming is nothing more than a
			medium of communication and anything worth saying probably comes from a place of
			empathy.<br />
		</p>

		<h1>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
		<br />

		<p>
			recently discovered I have extreme dyslexia and dyscalculia, and I am surprised that it
			took me so long to pick up on it——I was reminded of how difficult my experiences of
			classroom learning was by having to interact with highly technical written language for
			the first time in a long while.<br />
			I was also pleasantly surprised by the support I received around my learning difference
			and how I didn’t feel judged; And was even encouraged to ‘break the rules’ in terms of
			doing what I was asked, if it supported my learning, or was more honest to me (eg. I
			went a little ‘off book’ on my blog posts to reflect my experiences as a neurodivergent
			person and felt not only accepted in doing that, but it was practically celebrated.<br />
			It was exciting not to have to ‘hide’ or assimilate into material that may not be
			specifically meant to me; But also not coddled….I was simply allowed to make space for
			myself, without everyone else having to change their learning styles to accommodate me.
		</p>
		<br />

		<h1>were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>
		<br />

		<p>
			I found it challenging doing some heavy analyses of my thinking while undergoing
			diagnostic processes of ADHD and ASD for the first time (and only recently considering
			that I may be someone with ASD rather than an extremely traumatised neurotypical
			person). I do not think it was a bad thing to be challenged, but it was hard at times to
			examine the struggles I have with learning and being heard, and communicating them
			honestly.
		</p>
		<br />

		<h1>
			Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on
			core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
		</h1>
		<br />
		<p>
			It is the responsible thing to do.<br />
			The programming world has excluded particular groups of people for a long time and so
			contributing to that culture requires some decisions around what you would like to
			contribute; Sending people into the world and giving them the tools to be heard and
			amplify certain voices through the language of code, means you can contribute to a
			culture on a way the disrupts or supports the ‘status quo’.<br />
			I intend for instance, to use this opportunity to support other queer, neurodivergent
			people (and women) in the coding industry…when I have the tools to. <br />
		</p>
		<h1>
			Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should
			you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
		</h1>
		<br />
		<p>
			I have ADHD so I get agitated easily and impatient… I also think that some of the
			material may have been unnecessary or not directly useful to me personally (because I
			already go to therapy sessions and my neurodivergence means that some of the ideas are
			already things I have intimate experience with)…<br />
			In saying that, it was helpful to create space for myself within the core learning and
			‘defy’ my previous instinct of assimilating or appearing to assimilate when it came to
			conversations around the mind…it was very freeing.<br />
			I also think that irregardless of what parts I feel were personally helpful to me, it is
			something that is so necessary and made me feel a lot more comfortable with Dev academy
			in general. <br />
			Because, I would rather be in a classroom that makes empathy matter as much as anything
			else on the learning curriculum.<br />
			I think there is something to be said for not every question needing to be aimed at you,
			for it to be a question worth asking.<br />
			I felt like I could find a productive and honest way to answer the questions or use the
			time, even if it meant I strayed a little from what was being asked of me…<br />
			So, er, no, it was not a waste of time; But I am particularly grateful for it being part
			of the curriculum for those who may be unfamiliar with concepts of
			plasticity/empathy/boundry-setting/listening in an appropriate and respectful way, and
			may be being introduced to those things for the first time, or made to pay attention to
			them at the same time.<br />
			To me the tech content was all new and unfamiliar, and the core stuff was a little more
			familiar ; I think the core content needs to destabilise people who enter and are only
			comfortable and confident with tech, in the same way that the tech component needs to
			destabilise and challenge me…<br />
			I think that the people who would find this stuff really challenging (for other reasons
			than me) need to experience that discomfort and those growing pains and it was helpful
			for me in a more peripheral, abstract, playful way where it let me test some boundaries
			and ways of making space for my alternative thinking and learning styles.<br />
