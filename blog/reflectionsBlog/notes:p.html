<h1> Q: In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h1>
    <br>
<p>
I was surprised by how uncomfortable was with the language I encountered in my research…<br>
And terribly surprised that rather than be dishonest about my experience,
choose to make space for myself and my experiences, even at the risk of offending others. <br>
My experiences around ‘thought hacking’ and ‘optimised learning’  have mostly involved feeling abnormal or left-out, because my mind works so differently to the socialised norm, and this has made me a target of a lot of bad treatment. <br>

I think something I realised, was that, although I have spent years researching the human-brain, epigenetic, memory ect. I am still hugely uncomfortable with the language that we use to talk about learning, intelligence and brain-function.<br>
It often leaves out or passes value-judgement on the neurodivergent ——or, might just bring up bad memories and experiences for some.<br>
I came across a few ideas I disagreed with ——Not because I don’t believe they would be unhelpful for others, but because they were not very helpful for me personally, because learning and brain-function is so personal, and often texts on it cater to ‘typical’ brain functioning; <br>
A lot of sources implied a didactic singular way to manipulate the plasticity of your mind, that ‘increased brain function’ (as though that is possible!). And there was a focus on intelligence and things like IQ, which troublingly has it’s origins in eugenics and measures ‘intelligence’ according to a very narrow margin of typical presentation….usually a type of intelligence that means it’s possessor can contribute to capitalism and be a ‘successful, productive’, producing (and consuming) member of society….<br>
So, I found that frustrating. <br>
Any article that claims to know ‘how the mind works’ and does not mention the room for difference isn’t particularly interesting to me, though I see the importance to those who don’t consider themselves capable of change or find it difficult to empathise with the fluidity of experience others may exhibit. <br>

<h1>Q: In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h1>
<br>

<p>
I suppose it is the first time I have recognised feeling excluded from an idea and clocking that it is because a lot of the texts and 
discussions around it reflect a dominant ideology of normality that I do not experience and there for it was not a matter of me not ‘fitting’ the material, but the material not fitting me. <br>
I enjoyed pushing some boundries, and risking being honest…
I wait with bated breathe to see how this is received and will finish by saying, that I don’t expect every learning-excersise to fit me specifically, and I know others may find things useful that I do not…
But I think it is cool to communicate why I might feel a material isn’t aimed at me, or where my discomfort comes from. <br>
</p>


<h1>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h1>
<br>

<p>
I will not integrate this learning in particular…even though I understand how focusing on/researching these topics would benefit others.<br>
I spent five years intensely researching cognitive function and ways to manipulate the mind/memory when I was diagnosed with C-PTSD…and, well, I went a bit too deep. <br>
So now, I try to relax and not be too specific about how I learn. <br>
I have dyslexia, ASD and ADHD…so of-cores I will continue to find ways to support my learning and affirm my ability to learn…but reading sources on how my brain works is something that I have hyper-fixated on in an attempt to ‘cure’ my neuro-divergance, so I will treat them with caution.<br>

Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.<br>

I have recently endeavoured not to ‘mask’ my autism, and this includes pointing out when something might not fit me or be aimed at me. <br>
My learning strategy continues to be making space for myself, no matter how nerve-wracking it is to point-out my difference or the way I might have an unusual response to things others might be comfortable with.<br>
