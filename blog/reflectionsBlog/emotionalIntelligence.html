    <p>
        The French theorist, essayist and semiotician Roland Barthes once said ‚Äúlanguage is never innocent‚Äù.<br>
        We may surmise, from such a statement, that language, once produced---<i>whether witnessed or not---</i> <i>, acts</i> on a
        subject.<br>
        But how may it act?<br>
        Predictably?<br>
        In accordance with the rules?<br>
        Gravity and time seem to touch everyone and indeed <i>everything</i> with similar force and function, but what of words?<br>
        What of poetry and nuance and taste and interpretation?<br>
        Words can, and do, have a multiplicity of meanings and alter depending on their context.<br>
        Sure, there are patterns and structures and conventions that allow us to share definitions and understanding,
        but to presume that those definitions occur in the same way in the diversity of people‚Äôs minds is a stretch.<br>
        When I was a child I read and re-read ‚Äòfrog and toad are friends‚Äô by Arnold Lobel.<br>
        If you were to ask me now, to picture a frog, my image arrives to me in corduroy pants and a snug brown jacket.
        What do you picture? <br>
        What color is the frog? Is he friendly? 
        <br>
        Did you know that some people don‚Äôt picture anything at all? <br>
        The phenomenon is called <i>‚ÄòAphantasia‚Äô</i>; It means to be ‚Äòblinded in your mind‚Äôs eye‚Äô.<br>
        Language acts on a subject when they experience it through their language-senses---<i>site, hearing, touch ect.</i> and
        translate it in their mind; Each language-event has a multiplicity of meanings and translations; What it said, what is intended,
        what is presumed-to-be-understood, what is read as someone‚Äôs response, what is heard and understood and what is
        imagined or remembered later.<br>
        Sometimes ‚Äòlanguage‚Äô may involve deliberately and carefully leaving things out.
        <br>
        Can you think of a time where someone conveyed something to you with silence?<br>
        How did it feel?
        <br>
        Perhaps they scowled? Or passively-aggressively began doing the dishes?
        <br>
        Perhaps they held your hand.
        <br>
        The language of silence talks as loudly as most others, when you  listen.<br>
        Which isn‚Äôt to say that language always requires an audiance of listeners; Sometimes words may be poured privately, but
        meaningfully, into journals or roared in the mirror as pep-talks or bellowed as anthems in the shower, or, muttered as abuses 
        beneath our breath to vent anger at others or, sadly, ourselves.<br>
        We are told when we are young that "Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me," but the
        reality is that we rely on our communication abilities for all of Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy of human needs; ¬†‚Äú
        physiological (food and clothing), safety (job security), love and belonging (friendship), esteem, and
        self-actualization.<a href="#section1">[1]</a>.‚Äù
        <br>
        The child who arrives to school in unfashionable clothes is laughed at, and excluded; We learn to fit in.<br>
        A parent slams a cupboard a little-too-hard after a difficult day and we understand this to be the language of
        anger, we may try to sooth them with our limited tools. Or, we may invest words in the language of silence. 
        <br>
        Language is not neutral because we‚Äî‚Äî<i>imperfect vessels, imperfect audiences</i>‚Äî-are not neutral and
        experience the world through a lens of socialised, observed, genetic, cultural and chemical distortions.
        We are the opposite of neutral, and although ‚Äònormal‚Äô and ‚Äòabnormal‚Äô can be broadly recognised and understood,
        the definitions are far from firm or ‚Äòtheological‚Äô; Indeed they shift, they adapt, they are noticed and
        re-noticed, made and re-made, formed and reformed.<br>
        What was perfectly acceptable for our great-great-great-grandparents to say would be highly offensive now; The
        function of that language may not have altered much, but our collective acceptance and exaltation of those ideas
        have.
        <br>
        We <i>learn</i>. 
        <br>
        Generally, our ability to understand and manage language, communication and the emotional responses of ourselves
        and others is referred to as <i>emotional intelligence</i>.
        <br>
        While IQ‚Äî-a form of standardised testing supposed to measure one‚Äôs¬†intelligence quotient‚Äî- lets us know who we
        ought to exult based on their presumed intellect, there is no-such measure for emotional intelligence.
        <br>
        There is, however, some diagnosable conditions commonly associated with a lack of emotional intelligence.
        <br>
        Autism Spectrum disorder, for instance, makes reading body-language cues that are simple for most, extremely
        difficult and more of a manual process.
        Because of this, people on the ASD spectrum are often regarded as naive or lacking emotional intelligence‚Ä¶
        <br>
        It is ironic, perhaps, that I myself, an autistic person, intend to teach you, reader, about emotional intelligence. 
        But just as it may be difficult for a fish to describe 'water', or the sun to describe 'heat', it may be useful for myself---<br>
        Someone at odds with social 'norms' and 'cues' to talk about the perplexing world of feelings.<br>
        Not from a place of understanding, but from a place of perplexion.<br>
        With the understanding that some things do not make sense, because they (we) are insensable, sensing-machined.

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
        Firstly, let‚Äôs put things into context. <br>
        The world is huge.<br>
        Big.<br>
        Very-very-very-biggly-big. <br>
        Unimaginably so. <br>
        Close your eyes and picture 7.753 billion people; That is how many, give-or-take, are roaming around this
        planet; All with hopes and dreams, anxieties, interests, hobbies and routines.<br>
        7.753 billion individual ways of rubbing against and experiencing the world.<br>
        Dizzying, is it not? <br>
        Within that 7.753 billion people are various characteristics and traits that form patterns, which we come to know as
        ‚Äònormal‚Äô and ‚Äòappropriate‚Äô.
        <br>
        It may not be until our adult years that we begin to grasp just how many people fit outside the socially-constrained and constructed margins of ‚Äònormality‚Äô. 
        <br>
        More importantly, we may begin to notice how different another‚Äôs experience may be to our own and look, for perhaps the first time, with compassionate eyes, upon the struggles of others. 
                <br>
                What may be easy for some may be muddling for another. What may be rather pleasant for some may result in unimaginable panic or trigger horrible memories for another; They may become violent or offended by what seemed to you like an innocent joke or even a complement!
                <br>
        ‚ÄúTo each their own‚Äù we say. Or, ‚ÄúIt takes all sorts‚Äù.
        <br>
                Although I disagree with the idea of evaluating intelligence according to quantitative analysis, It is puzzling to me that no-such assessment exists for ‚Äòemotional intelligence‚Äô.
        <br>
        Perhaps the difference is that emotions, uniformly, do not make sense. 
        <br>
        Feelings are illogical, messy, unknowable, exhausting and fraught with misunderstandings.
        <br>
        Mostly, we are unable to accurately describe what is swirling around in our own mind, let alone navigate the emotional landscape of another. 
        <br>
        ‚ÄòNeurotypical‚Äô is the name we give those whose patterns of behaviour are most frequently  observed and documented in the population.
        <br>
        But the science is messy and complex and it doesn‚Äôt take an autistic mind to tell you that feelings are puzzling.
                <br>
        For instance, while a high IQ and ‚Äòhigh intelligence‚Äô are often associated with wealth and success, the befits of emotional intelligence are more muddy. 
        <br>
        In fact, compassion, patience and kindness are often rewarded with exploitation, cruelty and
                sneering.
              <br>
                Those who are socialised to be societies caregivers ‚Äî‚Äî<i>typically women or fems</i>‚Äî‚Äî- may be expected
                to preform unpaid emotional labour and minimise their own hurt feelings, in order that they have the space to nurture the hurt of another.
                <br>
        We may be told to care for others, be lady-like and gentle, then mocked and experience derision for those very
                qualities.
                <br>
                Contrastingly‚Äî‚Äîyet painfully‚Äî- those who are regarded as societies strong stoic leaders may be expected to
                dismiss and attack their own and other‚Äôs ‚Äòsoft feelings‚Äô and conceal their own vulnerability, or risk ridicule and exclusion from the pack‚Ä¶
                <br>
                Which begs the question, why bother with empathy at all?
                <br>
                Wouldn‚Äôt selfishness be a lot more convenient?
                <br>
                Studies on sociopathy reveal that one in five business leaders may have sociopathic traits and be less able to empathise with others. 
        <br>
        So could caring less serve us more?
                <br>
               <i> Perhaps.</i>
                <br>
               To me, it is a matter of intention.
        <br>
        Many of the great wonders and pleasures of life‚Äî‚Äî<I> a good book, a thrilling conversation, a lovingly made meal, an intriguing piece of art</I> ‚Äî‚Äîexist because their creators had a desire to connect and share something; A feeling, an idea, an observation, a joke.
        <br>
        Which is to say, that the act of creation, has always seemed to me, to be a great act of communion, connection and kinship. 
        <br>
        A language not-unlike friendship or love. 
        <br>
        True artists, authors, creators and observers-of-patterns have the ability to notice difference and struggle and disruption-of-order and find the beauty and the curiosity in that. And, even more wonderfully, the language to talk about (and too) difference. 
        <br>
        Coding, like any other language or art, involves emotional intelligence; It is with the tools of empathy and love that we can seek to communicate more inclusively and openly; That we can use our skills of pattern-noticing to alter the patterns in the world that exclude people and make them feel lonely, helpless or silenced. 
        It is with these tools that we learn to listen and create the tools that the previously-unheard require or desire. 
        It is with these tools that we collaborate, celebrate and share knowledge. 
        <br>
        I don‚Äôt know about you, but I just want to make people feel heard.
