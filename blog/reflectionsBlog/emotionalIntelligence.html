    <p>
        The French theorist, essayist and semiotician Roland Barthes once said “language is never innocent”.<br>
        We may suppose, from such a statement, that language, once produced, whether witnessed or not, acts on a
        subject.<br>
        But how will it act?<br>
        Predictably?<br>
        Does it follow rules?<br>
        Gravity and time seem to touch everything and everyone in similar manners, but what of words?<br>
        What of poetry and nuance and taste and interpretation?<br>
        Words can have a multiplicity of meaning and alter depending on context.<br>
        Sure, there are patterns and structures and conventions that allow us to share definitions and understanding,
        but to presume that those definitions occur in the same way in the diversity of people’s minds is a stretch.<br>
        When I was a child I read and re-read ‘frog and toad are friends’ by Arnold Lobel. If you ask me to picture a
        frog, my image comes in corduroy pants and a snug brown jacket.
        What do you picture? <br>
        Did you know that some people don’t picture anything at all? <br>
        The phenomenon is called ‘Aphantasia’; It means to be ‘blinded in your mind’s eye’.<br>
        Language acts on a subject when they experience it through their language-senses (site, hearing, touch ect.) and
        translate it in their mind; Each language-event has a multiplicity of meaning; What it said, what is intended,
        what is presumed-to-be-understood, what is read as someone’s response, what is heard and understood and what is
        imagined or remembered later.<br>
        Sometimes ‘language’ may involve deliberately and carefully leaving things out. Can you think of a time where
        someone conveyed something to you with silence?<br>
        Perhaps they scowled? Or passively-aggressively began doing the dishes?
        The language of silence talks as loudly as most others, when you begin to listen.<br>
        Which isn’t to say that language always requires an audience; Sometimes it is poured privately, but
        meaningfully, into journals or
        communicated unto ourselves in mirror pep-talks or bellowed anthems in the shower and abuses, muttered, beneath
        our breath to vent anger at others or our own foolishness.<br>
        We are told when we are young that "Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me," but the
        reality is that we rely on our communication abilities for all of Maslow’s hierarchy of human needs;  “
        physiological (food and clothing), safety (job security), love and belonging needs (friendship), esteem, and
        self-actualization.<a href="#section1">[1]</a>.”
        <br>
        The child who arrives to school in unfashionable clothes is laughed at, and excluded; We learn to fit in.
        A parent slams a cupboard a little-too-hard after a difficult day and we understand this to be the language of
        anger, we may try to sooth them.
        <br>
        Language is not neutral because we——<i>imperfect vessels, imperfect audiences</i>—-are not neutral and
        experience the world through a lens of socialised, observed, genetic, cultural and chemical distortions.
        We are the opposite of neutral, and although ‘normal’ and ‘abnormal’ can be broadly recognised and understood,
        the definitions are far from firm or ‘theological’; Indeed they shift, they adapt, they are noticed and
        re-noticed, altered.<br>
        What was perfectly acceptable for our great-great-great-grandparents to say would be highly offensive now; The
        function of that language may not have altered much, but our collective acceptance and exaltation of those ideas
        have.
        <br>
        Generally, our ability to understand and manage language, communication and the emotional responses of ourselves
        and others is referred to as ‘emotional intelligence’.
        <br>
        While IQ—-a form of standardised test supposed to measure one’s intelligence quotient—- lets us know who we
        ought to exult based on their presumed intellect, there is no-such measure for emotional intelligence.
        Although there are some diagnosable conditions that are associated with a lack of emotional intelligence.
        <br>
        Autism Spectrum disorder, for instance, makes reading body-language cues that are simple for most, extremely
        difficult and more of a manual deliberate process. Because of this, people on the ASD spectrum are often
        regarded as naive or lacking emotional intelligence…
        Which is why it is somewhat ironic that I would like to share my observations, through the tense of ASD, on
        emotional intelligence and why I think it is important, yet highly misunderstood.

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
        Firstly, let’s put things into context. <br>
        The world is huge. <br>
        Big. <br>
        Very-very-very-biggly-big. <br>
        Unimaginably so. <br>
        Close your eyes and picture 7.753 billion people; That is how many, give-or-take, are roaming around this
        planet; All with hopes and dreams, anxieties, interests, hobbies and routines.<br>
        7.753 billion individual ways of rubbing against and experiencing the world.<br>
        It is truely dizzying. <br>
        Within that 7.753 billion are various characteristics and traits that form patterns, which we come to know as
        ‘normal’ and ‘appropriate’; It may not be until our adult years that we begin to grasp however just how many
        people or experiences those categories exclude or just how different another person’s experience may be from our
        own.
        <br>
        What may be easy for some may cause another to struggle. What may be rather pleasant for some may result in
        unimaginable panic or trigger horrible memories for another; They may become violent or offended by what seemed
        to you like an innocent joke or even a complement!
        <br>
        Although I disagree with the idea of an ‘emotional quotient’, or evaluating people in any other
        narrowly-margined way, we are going to use the term ‘emotional intelligence’ here to talk about the way in which
        we engage with the exceedingly complex, unknowable and often messy world of emotion; Exhausting, illogical and
        fraught with possible failures and misunderstanding—-Let’s dive it!
        <br>
        Neurotypical people may present the most standard and typical patterns and behaviours in terms of processing and
        observing emotions, but the world over, emotions are messy, complicated and confusing and it doesn’t take an
        autistic mind to find feelings puzzling or overwhelming at times.
        <br>
        Unlike intelligence, which is often associated with wealth and success, the benefits of emotional intelligence
        may seem muddy; In fact, compassion, patience and kindness can often be rewarded with exploitation, cruelty and
        sneering.
        <br>
        Those who are socialised to be societies nurturers and caregivers ——typically women or fems——- may be expected
        to preform as unpaid councillors and expected to minimise and hide their own feelings to create space for the
        feelings of others.
        <br>
        We may be told to care for others, be lady-like and gentle, then mocked and face derision for those very
        qualities.
        <br>
        Contrastingly——yet painfully—- those who are regarded as societies strong stoic leaders may be expected to
        dismiss other’s feelings and conceal their own softness, or risk radical and exclusion from the pack…
        <br>
        Which begs the question, why bother with empathy at all?
        <br>
        Wouldn’t it be easier to give-in to selfishness?
        <br>
        Studies on sociopathy reveal that one in five business leaders may have sociopathic traits and be unable to
        empathise with others—-Wouldn’t caring less serve us more?
        <br>
        Perhaps.
        <br>
        I suppose it is a matter of intention; For many, one of the fundamental pursuits in life beyond money and
        accolades is the desire to be seen——truely seen!——and loved for who you are. <br>
        Many of the most pleasurable aspects of life——reading, watching films, enjoying artwork, playing games——-comes
        from a creators desire to connect and share something——-an idea, a feeling, an observation——with an audience
        member.
        <br>
        It is an act of communion, connection and kinship.
        <br>
        As artists, creators or observers-of-patters, our ability to see and notice difference in others and our
        attempts to bridge any language-or-emotional-barriers and communicate inclusively and openly to others , gives
        our work significance and purpose.
        <br>
        Coding, like other art forms, is a language of communication; Emotional intelligence is just one tool that we
        must learn that patterns of, if we are to use code effectively or meaningfully.
        <br>
        The sooner we recognise the beautiful, complex and sometimes messy multiplicity of being, the more aware and
        capable we may become of using out voice in a way that matters;
        <br>
        To hold space for others. To listen better. To include the silenced, the marginalised, the hurt, the ignored. To
        embrace and notice and love more effectively and honestly.
        <br>
        I don’t know about you, but my favourite type of interactions —-my favourite texts, artworks, films, people—-
        make me feel a lot less lonely; And although I am not willing to measure that on a quoter, I am thrilled at the
        idea of adding that observation to whatever other pattern-observations I make, as I learn how to code.
