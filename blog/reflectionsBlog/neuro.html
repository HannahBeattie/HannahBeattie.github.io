<h1> 🧠 _i_d_o_n_'_t_m_i_n_d_🧠 </h1>
<p> 
Your mind, like my mind, has a tremendous capacity to learn, re-learn, adapt and change and this is sometimes known as ‘neuroplasticity’. <br>
Your mind, like my mind contains unknowable patterns and habits, filters, formulation, social-and-chemical conditions and understanding.<br>
It is shaped by experience, by genetics, by memory, by hormonal fluctuations, by chemical interactions…<br>
It may inherit traits and thought-traits biologically or through careful noticing and repeated interaction. <br>
Nevertheless, the thing to think about, is that minds are shaped; Not like concrete or marble statutes, but more like the squelchy, squeezable slack of wet clay. <br>
Only, unlike clay, the meat-and-matter-of-the-mind is always absorbing.<br>
If you were aware, of every detail that your mind is aware of, at all times, you would probably be driven crazy.<br>
In what is sometimes known as “losing your mind”, but might, more accurately be called, ‘exhibiting an awareness that is unfamiliar or abnormal to our comfortable majority’.<br>
Perhaps one of the most delightful phrases in the world may be “I changed my mind”.<br>
You see, I love the plasticity (and play) of thinking about thinking. <br>
Which is why it was so surprising to me, that I was frustrated, by being asked to research neuroplasticity. <br>
My assumption at first was that I would thoroughly enjoy this task. After-all, I have twenty-three books on brain function, thinking and thinking-through-the-body.<br>
My previous profession involved carefully and deliberately reading body-language and tapping into the intention and behaviours of others——thinking differently. <br>
So why did the dread? <br>
<I>I thought I would enjoy this exercise, then I changed my mind.</i>
<br>
First some context; Neuroscientists, psychiatrists, molecular biologists and neuroendocrinologists are often brilliant pattern-notices. <br>
It is their job to notice patterns in other people’s pattern-noticing-machines. <br>

If any such specialist glanced at my medical records they could probably describe the ways in which my brain function is abnormal. <br>


This is the part in the story where some neurotypical people would feel the need to reassure me that everyone is different (which is true) and the part where I patiently point out that ‘difference’ in a pattern is not inherently ‘wrong’ or ‘bad’…even though the idea of an ‘abnormal’ brain may make everyone feel a little jumpy. 
<br>
I have several diagnoses that would make my brain statistically abnormal… <br>
And although I believe that ‘normality’ is a broad, messy spectrum in itself, it is worth noting that the being ‘different’, or ‘other’  rather often involves being left-out or punished for what is presumed to be deliberate (or ‘unnatural’) defiance. <br>


We boast about having high IQs, forgetting that that term played a central role in the atrocities of eugenics. <br>
We talk about being “triggered” without understanding the necessity of that word to those who experience the medical definition of that word. And we discuss learning as though there is a singular way to learn, rather than patters that may be likely to work for many minds. <br>


It occurred to me, when I was asked to research ‘neuroplasticity’, as though it were a new concept, that I have never had the privilege of passing as ‘normal’. <br>
Therefore, I have been told over-and-again to comply with ‘normal’ processes of learning, thinking and behaving.
<br>
I discovered the plasticity of the human mind, because, as an atypical child, I desperately grasped at any idea that might transform me into a ‘normal’, ‘functioning’ (ie. neurotypical) member of society. <br>
A fair amount of my energy over the years has gone to disrupting thinking-patterns that the world reinforced as abnormal, and therefore, wrong. <br>
It took me years to learn to accept that my difference could be something that I liked about myself… <br>
And although I am glad that I learnt early on that I was capable of changing and adapting…<br>
I learnt that lesson harshly. Not through a desire to be more successful than others, but as a desire to escape harassment and even violence. 
<br>


Being asked to research neuroplasticity is for me, like asking a fish to research whether or not water is wet, or asking a dog to research whether or not they are a very good boy. I am well aware that my mind can change. It frequently does…I am grateful for the lesson, but it is one I have never had the privilege of not knowing.<br>

So, rather than researching neuroplasticity, I am instead choosing to delight you with my favourite brain-facts. <br>
But first, lets think about the brain. <br>
Picture it: All pink and squishy, meat and goo… 
Consider how different your mind is from mine, or from your friends.
What you notice, enjoy, are curious about and anxious about are peculiarly yours and occur in part because of the exquisite jumbled, circuitous, learning-organ knocking around in your skull<br>
Your brain is particularly spectacular because it loves learning and pattern-recognition.<br>
No matter how much you dull it out with tv, alcohol or sedatives; A living brain is a learning brain.  <br>
In fact, the idea of a flexible and ‘plastic’ mind is very old; Pre-dating theories of a ‘hysterical’ uterus roaming around a female’s body, causing ‘female hysteria’.
The word ‘mind’ comes from the old English world ‘geymynd’ or ‘memory, thought’, which in turn comes from Indo-European and Germanic origin, which talked about a mind that revolved in thought. <br>
Luckily, it is a fallacy that one can ‘increase neuroplasticity’. <br>
It would be like claiming you can ‘tone a muscle’ when a muscle is zero percent fat.  <br>
You can however manipulate and alter the way in which you absorb certain information and deliberately practice a particular action and idea, turning it into one of those delicious patterns that your mind just LOVES noticing. 
<br>

<p>

In trauma therapy, it is not uncommon to undergo cognitive behavioural therapy, in which you deliberately interrupt and alter a well-warn pattern. <br>
That is because ‘disorders’ such as PTSD and C-PTSD involve your brain trying to protect you, by going over a traumatic memory again and again, searching for all the ways in which it might prevent anything similar occurring again. <br>
Like a stuck record, it will re-play the same tiny snippet of information until the ‘gove’ of that neural-pathway is so intrenched, that it is the most obvious part for your thoughts to take. <br>
It becomes the most familiar route to a brain that desires order, stability and…dare I say it again? Patterns. <br>

<h1> Practice makes perfect </h1>
<p>
There is no singular way to increase one’s learning, but it is possible to direct your attention and focus to a particular subject or make a pattern more familiar (and therefore a more logical and likely thought-path) for your mind to follow. <br> 

Some methods of pattern-manipulation might include mindful (deliberate) learning, intention, an elevated learning-intensity over a short duration, practicing something for an extended period of time and repeating a learning-action over and over——<br>
Fun fact: It is thought that memory exists throughout the body, including in the organs and muscles! This is known as ‘procedural memory’. Even those studying it are not sure why and how it works, though the research around it runs parallel to research around cellular memory, epigenetic and adaptive immune memory. <br>

<br>
Another method of patten-manipulation, commonly used as a study air, is disrupting a moment of habitual or unconscious-thinking, with an unusual action. <br>
For instance, someone may read something important in a comical voice. Try chewing gum while completing a task….or read a section of text while standing on one foot.  <br>

<h1>Growth mindset </h1>

<br>
<p>
It surprised me how much I cringed looking at resources around min-hacking, growth mindset and ‘learning’ that were suggesting a uniformed mechanism for learning and did not take into account the difference of many non-neurotypical minds. 
<br>
It reminded me of auseating life-coaches and dudebrows educating me on how thrilling it is to learn that you can adapt your thinking.,,without needing to do it for safety or just to exist.<br>
<br>
So, again, instead of researching growth-mindset sources aimed at different brains to mine, I want to talk about the exquisite joy of not knowing and, marvellously, fucking-up. 
<br>
One of the best ways to notice patterns and difference and how something works, is through making mistakes. 
<br>
We could call this, the Bob Ross school of thought, in which We don't make mistakes -- we just have happy accidents.”<br>
Often failing at something over and over again teaches you a lot about what you are trying to do. <br>
It is terribly interesting, so-long as you notice what occurs and don’t get distracted by wanting things to have gone ‘correctly’ <br>
I very much enjoy gardening; It teaches you to be patient. <br>
When building a garden, there are times where all you can do it tend the soil and create the conditions for growth…knowing that the resilient little bulbs and seeds nestled deep in the dark will have to spend a long while collecting nutrients and energy before they appear to your eyes.
<br>
Similarly, a lot of learning may occur painfully, slowly and invisible before you are even aware of it.<br>

Often the best thing to do, is practice failure. Again and again, until it gets a little less uncomfortable and you are ready to learn from it.
<br>
A ‘growth mind-set’ may have ‘mind-optimising’ associations that I find unpleasant, but the ideas inside it are rather fine; Which is that, learning involves risk. Changing involves loss.

And it may be useful for us to view our failures and confusion and feelings of inadequacy through more generous eyes; As daring attempts to stretch towards the light and grow.
