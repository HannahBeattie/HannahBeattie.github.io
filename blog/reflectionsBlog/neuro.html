I was asked to talk about ‚Äòneuroplasticity‚Äô, which is weird, because the possibility of a fixed and static mind has never occurred to me...<br>
As someone with a peculiar, atypical brain, l, I spent many years adapting, masking and practicing versions of self-led compliance therapy, in order that I could seem to fit into society. <br>

I had to learn to perform facial expressions, behavioural body-language cues and speech patterns in a way that fit dominant social norms, because otherwise I experienced harassment or violence.<br>
 
As such being asked to research neuroplasticity or considering the idea that one could adapt their thought patterns and behavioural patters seemed a little like being asked to research whether fire is hot or water is wet.<br>
I have had to alter who I am and how I move in society constantly. <br>
Classrooms and school programs were not tailored to the learning needs of an ASD, ADHD, C-PTCD dyslexic little queer kid, with an abusive family and an unfashionable haircut. <br>
I have undergone extensive cognitive behavioural therapy over the years and had to recognise and adapt my brain-pattern behaviours in order to survive or avoid abuse‚Ä¶<br>
So, well,  it seems like something of a privilege to reach adulthood and not have spent years changing core parts of your behaviour and knowing that you are able to adapt (because, again and again, violently, you have had to).<br>

I am choosing not to research neuroplasticity, because of the extensive research I did on brain-chemistry as a childhood, when I was trying to figure out why I was ‚Äòabnormal‚Äô and found learning so difficult. <br>
Instead I am going to talk about my favourite brain-facts. <br>
First, the brain is a jumbled, circuitous, learning-organ, more complicated than we could ever know. <br>
It loves certain types of stimulation, as well as recognising patterns. <br>
In history, it has often been conceived-of as flexible and moving; In fact the word ‚Äòmind‚Äô comes from the old English world ‚Äògeymynd‚Äô or ‚Äòmemory, thought‚Äô, which in turn comes from Indo-European and Germanic origin, with its root meaning being to ‚Äòrevolve in the mind, think‚Äô. <br>
Rather wonderfully, it is a fallacy that one can ‚Äòincrease neuroplasticity‚Äô; It would be like ‚Äòtoning a muscle‚Äô; Muscles can grow or shrink but cannot become firmer or softer, just more visible based on how we use them. <br>
Similarly, everyones brain is capable of learning and taking-in information. Only, repudiative acts and particular learning processes can be more successful in manipulating the types of information a brain gravitates towards, or how easy it is to recall a particular memory. <br>
For instance, since I have C-PTSD, my brain is a little like a stuck record, and re-plays the same memories over and over again, making the ‚Äògrove‚Äô or neural-pathway more obvious in my brain, and more likely to be re-trod. <br>
Similarly, the idiom of ‚Äòpractice makes perfect‚Äô could apply; If your body repeats a certain activity over and over again, your brain and body begins to familiarise itself with that pattern, and it becomes easier to recall and perform. <br>
Some methods that people use to manipulate the way their mind stores information are; mindful (deliberate) learning, intention, an elevated learning-intensity over a short duration, practicing something for an extended period of time and repeating a learning-action over and over‚Äî‚Äî<br>
Fun fact: It commonly believed that memory exists all over the body, including in the organs and muscles! This is known as ‚Äòprocedural memory‚Äô. Even those studying it are not sure why and how it works, though the research around it runs parallel with research and hypotheses  around cellular memory, epigenetic and adaptive immune memory. <br>
Another method of memory-forming that is not necessarily associated with typical plasticity-methods, is disrupting a feeling of familiarity (or unconscious-thinking) while completing an activity you wish to remember; For instance, reading something in a comical voice. Chewing gum while completing a task. Or going over an important quote while standing on one foot.  <br>

Growth mindset <br>
I was surprised by how uncomfortable I was, looking into growth mindset and other mind-hacking theories; A lot of the language around ‚Äòsuccess‚Äô, ‚Äòlearning‚Äô and ‚Äòknowledge‚Äô reminds me uncomfortably of the stigma of having a different learning style and atypical thinking patterns. <br>
I associate a lot of ‚Äòsuccess experts‚Äô with nauseating life-coaches privileged dudebrows educating me on how thrilling it is to learn that you can adapt your thinking..<br>
Without having any awareness of what it is like to have to be fluid and malleable from a far younger age, just to survive. <br>
Instead of researching growth mindset and experiencing the sense of exclusion and loneliness I feel reading sources written for neurotypical brain-function (or at least, not my type of atypical), I would like to again talk about a way in which I have learnt to learn;<br>
Which is the Bob Ross approach of seeing failure or missteps and treating them as learning-experiences and chances to notice patterns. <br>
Indeed, "We don't make mistakes -- we just have happy accidents.‚Äù<br>
Often failing at something over and over again teaches you a lot about what you are trying to do. <br>
It is terribly interesting, so-long as you stop to notice and enjoy the details of each flair. <br>
In gardening, there are long periods of time when nothing grows in a visible way. <br>
You have to tend the soil and be patient as the resilient little seeds and bulbs collect nutrients and energy. <br>
Similarly, creating the conditions-for‚Äîlearning-growth might involve some waiting and deliberate, careful nurturance. <br>
It might involve invisible progress at times, and sitting with the discomfort of not knowing how and when you will be able to reap the spoils of your toil. <br>
Learning involves risking discomfort, over-and-over again. <br>
Perhaps it involves failing and feeling very stupid at times; Or, perhaps it involves seeing ‚Äòfailure‚Äô through more generous eyes, as a learning opportunity. <br>
