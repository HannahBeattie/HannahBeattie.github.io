        <p>There is a book by J.M.Barrie called Little White Bird, and in it a line that goes ‚ÄúShall we make a new rule of life from tonight: always be a little kinder than necessary‚Äù.<br>
        I have never had a problem being kind; It is a genuine pleasure to find beauty in observing the strength, excitements, curiosities and interests in others‚Ä¶<br>
        However, I have in the past struggled to make space for myself along with that which I make for others. <br>
        More recently I have re-framed the idea of ‚Äòboundaries‚Äô and ‚Äòdistance‚Äô in my head; rather than seeing those things as limiting or punishing, I have considered the ways in which firm boundaries and expectations are a great act of respect and honesty.<br> 

        I know that I am able to treat people with respect and compassion, regardless of how badly they treat me, but in the past I have struggled to hold people who I am close to accountable for bad behaviour or expect consistent fair treatment.<br>

        The impulse is to dismiss particular behaviour as someone having a rough day or ‚Äògoing through something‚Äô.<br>

        Recently, I encountered someone who worked as a competitor in my professional field who was astoundingly hostile and began spreading rumours about me in the workplace, talking negatively about me to shared clients and even sending me abusive messages.<br>

        Despite the huge amount of stress I experienced from this, I was very glad that I was able to firmly let her know that further harassment would not be tolerated, but that I was unwilling to engage in any kind of mud-slinging in the workplace. <br>
        I shut down conversations where people wanted me to ‚Äòshare the goss‚Äô about this particular erratic person and said that I wanted to keep our work spaces neutral. <br>
    
        Jobs where a huge amount of emotional labour and intimacy is woven in can often have very muddy boundaries so I have always been incredibly cautious to practice good, respectful workplace boundaries regardless of my feelings towards a person; This is not the same as tolerating abusive behaviour, but it does mean that I don‚Äôt see disliking someone as a good enough reason to behave badly towards them.<br>

        It is important to me that no-matter how bad, messy or ugly a situation I encounter, I behave with compassion and in a way that I can be proud of, no-matter the petty, hurtey impulses.<br>



        My early experiences of growing up in a dysfunctional cult-like family of religious extremists means I have a deep awareness of unfair treatment, a mistrust of blind authority and a sensitivity to both power imbalances and how my voice may be amplified over others.<br> 

        If Spider-man taught us anything, it is that with great power comes great responsibility and my family taught me to always be aware of who you are taking orders from and what is being gained (by who?).<br>


        One of my biggest strengths is my curious, deliberate enthusiasm for noticing things. I love making art and learning things by making mistakes, testing solutions and re-testing them.<br> 
        I am resilient, daring and always excited to find new methods of noticing things.<br> 

        I think that coding seems like a terribly exciting way to notice patterns and play with words, images, maths and ways of communicating with people.<br>

        I don‚Äôt think I do have any limitations in learning; I know that I struggle a lot with taking in some types of written language. I also get pissed off at the misogyny that I have already experienced in the industry; And how my own internalised misogyny and experiences of exclusion and being mocked in male-dominated or coded spaces means I put myself down a bunch or presume I will do badly‚Ä¶
        But those aren‚Äôt limitations, they are more like obstacles. 
        Obstacles can be cleared, they just take effort and I am not afraid of hard work.<br>

        One of the questions in the corse book asked me to talk about an ethical dilemma I encountered in my work place; For me there have been many supposed ethical dilemmas (as I worked in an industry that had a fair amount of exploitation); However, one experience involved me realising I was getting treated a lot better than other employees and privately approaching my manager to let her know that I was uncomfortable that she was prioritising me over others based on my ability to earn money; Because every employee should have equal respect, as a bare minimum.<br> 
        I was cautious but clear in my approach and honestly I wouldn‚Äôt change how I handled that situation.<br> 
        I have faced many situations like that and I would always rather use my voice to stand up for those who don‚Äôt have the opportunity to be heard or may not have the safety or confidence‚Ä¶
        I do my best to be ethical under capitalism‚Ä¶and I would absolutely risk money to do that. Often however, I find that speaking openly and respectfully to someone when I have a concern is helpful and improves the relationship and the work-place, so I intend to continue to use my voice.<br> 

        Thank you for coming to my ted talk.<br>

        The end.
        <br>
        <br>
