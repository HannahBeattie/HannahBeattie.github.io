		<h1>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h1>

		<p>
			My long term goal is something I am not ready to establish completely. I have worked
			freelance in various fields for the last seven years and would like to continue doing
			that, but because code is so new to me and I am only beginning to experience it for the
			first time, I don‚Äôt want to put pressure or rigidity on my outcome. I know that when I
			am interested in something, I work hard, so either I will fall in love with coding
			(which I think is likely) or I won‚Äôt. I believe that I will probably get excited by many
			possibilities career-wise and find the type of code I enjoy writing and just allow
			myself to follow what feels exciting and challenging.
		</p>
		< Right now, I am just noticing what I enjoy. A description of your own strengths and
		limitations in relation to learning

		<p>
			My strengths in learning are around my creativity, excitement and ability to focus
			intensely on something I am passionate about and make assignments interesting to me. I
			do not think I have limitations in learning, however I sometimes struggle to take breaks
			and connect with my life outside of work when I am fascinated by/excited to learn
			something new. I also get rather hard on myself if I feel like I am progressing slowly
			or mess up.
		</p>

		<h1>
			What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself
			while at Dev Academy?
		</h1>

		<p>
			I honestly feel pretty comfortable with a lot of my non-technical skills, although I
			suppose I could stand to be a little more patient with myself when I don‚Äôt know things
			and not just try to ‚Äòpush through‚Äô. I think being comfortable with not-knowing and find
			solving problems interesting rather than stressful could be a nice thing to aim for. A
			commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
			An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with
			other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives
		</p>

		<h1>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h1>

		<p>
			I suppose my focus will be on communicating clearly, honestly and not taking things too
			seriously. I am not concerned about my ability to work hard. I take my mental and
			physical health very seriously and am cautious of the way I communicate with others. I
			don‚Äôt take out my frustration or anger on others, so my only concerns would be about my
			ability to set boundaries and have clear expectations of others; But I think that it is
			likely that everyone here is wanting to learn, so if we have the same goal, it shouldn‚Äôt
			be too difficult to support one-another and look out for anyone who might be struggling.
			I have a good therapist, a great partner, cool friends and a cuddly cat; I think I will
			get stressed at times, but I will be ok. I value my health (mental/physical) above
			everything and I am confident in my ability to let people know if I'm struggling.
		</p>

		<h1>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h1>

		<p>
			I solemnly swear to seak help when I feel stuck; I will do a little google, a little
			troubleshoot and then ask.
		</p>

		<h1>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h1>

		<p>
			I hope that I can have some flexibility around the assignments to make them feel fun for
			myself; I learn best through playing, so I hope that there isn‚Äôt too much rigidity
			around exactness‚Ä¶ I suppose that is less of an expectation and more of a wish. An
			expectation would be a lack of judgement‚Ä¶which seems to be evident in my experiences
			so-far; I feel like my expectations have been exceeded, so I guess I expect more of the
			same; Not perfection, but kindness.
		</p>

		<h1>
			Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other
			things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It‚Äôs
			important to plan these in.
		</h1>

		<p>
			I see a therapist on Tuesday mornings and am planning to get my booster vaccine tomorrow
			‚Ä¶I won‚Äôt see my therapist during bootcamp but am during sprints. I have a partner and a
			cat who I like to make some time for‚Ä¶ Other than that I am pretty free.
